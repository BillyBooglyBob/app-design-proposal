# app-design-proposal

This proposal document sets out the design for Plantr, a proposed plant care mobile 
application within the behaviour change domain. 

The Plantr app is designed to make it easier for people to care for indoor plants. It aims 
to do this by providing the user with relevant information and an engaging and easy 
interface with which to monitor their indoor plants’ needs. 

This proposal document sets out the process through which our team at Evergreen 
Designs identified relevant issues and needs for a potential mobile application to fulfill, 
and the design of the mobile application Plantr. This proposal also discusses how
interactive design elements have been incorporated into Plantr’s features.
